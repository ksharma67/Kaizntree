# Deployment Guide for Frontend, Backend, and Database

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database for the project. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and access to deploy to your chosen hosting environment.

## Frontend Deployment

1. Navigate to the frontend directory of the project.

2. Build the Vue.js project for production:

``npm install``

``npm run build``

3. Once the build process is complete, you will find the production-ready files in the `dist/` directory.

4. Upload the contents of the `dist/` directory to your web server or hosting provider.

5. Ensure that your web server is properly configured to serve the frontend files.

## Backend Deployment (Django)

1. Navigate to the backend directory of the project.

2. Install the Python dependencies using pip:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

3. Set up your Django project settings, including database settings, secret key, allowed hosts, etc., in the appropriate configuration file (`settings.py`).

4. Migrate the database schema to ensure it's up to date:

``python manage.py migrate``

5. Optionally, create a superuser for accessing the Django admin interface:
   
``python manage.py createsuperuser``

6. Run the Django development server or deploy it using a production-ready server like Gunicorn or uWSGI:

``python manage.py runserver``

7. Make sure your backend server is accessible and properly configured.

### Database Deployment (PostgreSQL)

1. Install PostgreSQL on your server if it's not already installed.

2. Access the PostgreSQL command-line interface:

``psql -U postgres``

3. Create a new database named "kaizntree":
   
``CREATE DATABASE kaizntree;``

4. Create a new user and grant it privileges on the "kaizntree" database:

``CREATE USER your_username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';``

``GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kaizntree TO your_username;``

5. Make sure to update your Django settings with the database credentials and settings.

6. Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is properly configured and accessible.
